#  Mean and variance of a discrete  distribution


# Aim : 

To find mean and variance of arrival of objects from the feeder using probability distribution


# Software required :  

Python and Visual components tool

# Theory:

The expectation or the mean of a discrete random variable is a weighted average of all possible
values of the random variable. The weights are the probabilities associated with the corresponding values. 
It is calculated as,

The variance of a random variable shows the variability or the scatterings of the random variables.
It shows the distance of a random variable from its mean. It is calcualted as
